# GPIO Speed Test on a Raspberry Pi 2
Using a 3.5" screen using up more than half the I/O I was wondering if it was possible to use bitbanging to send data through one of the GPIO's. Since I haven't used C much on the RPi I found some examples on a wiki that I modified to test the speed using sysfs or direct hw access (mem).

This is my findings:
